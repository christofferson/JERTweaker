# JERTweaker

A Minecraft mod designed to allow
[CraftTweaker](https://github.com/CraftTweaker/CraftTweaker) scripts to control
the resources as displayed in
[Just Enough Resources](https://github.com/way2muchnoise/JustEnoughResources).

This version was created out of necessity and as such I have no intentions to
backport or even maintain this mod. It's released here purely in the hopes that
someone else may find it useful. Currently only works with Minecraft 1.18.2.

Documentation is not provided, but the functions aren't particularly complex and
relevant code for scripts can be found in the `com.khepri.jertweaker.zen`
package of the sources.
